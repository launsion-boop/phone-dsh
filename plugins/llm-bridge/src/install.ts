 * tools, MCP over HTTP and telemetry); this module swaps the transport at the
 * same level, so every fetch consumer works under `--jitless` unchanged.

 * The transport is installed even when WebAssembly exists: in the phone Worker
 * the browser's WebAssembly is present, but no `node:http` client exists, so

 * the Worker's own fetch. `nativeFetchUsable` is retained as a diagnostic.
 *
 * `node:http` transport is loaded lazily: the Worker path never evaluates the
 * node:https client, so the runtime module table does not need a usable
 * `node:https` module and no `https.Agent` is constructed there. The desktop
 * implementation only resolves when a request actually needs it.
 *
 * The Worker host route is found from the environment the entry sets before
 * DSH boots: `PDSH_CHANNEL_TOKEN` (bearer) and `PDSH_CHANNEL_URL` /
 * `PDSH_CHANNEL_ORIGIN` (loopback origin), with the desktop names as fallbacks.

 * Wraps a platform response so a suspended downstream consumer can resume.

 * The host gateway may have received a complete model response while the
 * Worker's platform fetch stops receiving bytes (a suspended WebKit page, a
 * broken stream hop). The wrapper counts the bytes it actually delivered; when
 * an inactivity interval expires on an open body it asks the host for the same
 * response from that byte offset (``RESUME_FROM_HEADER``). The host serves the
 * suffix from its committed response log, so the model client sees one
 * continuous body and the delivery window is replenished instead of abandoned.
 *
 * The inactivity interval is measured on the active clock: a window that
 * expired because iOS froze the Worker is recovered the same way (a resume at
 * the delivered offset, which also re-arms the window) instead of failing the
 * turn for time the process never ran. The resume budget bounds both cases.
 *
 * The typed ``DeliveryTimeoutError`` is still the failure of last resort: with
 * no resumable host body, or after ``maxResumes``, the body errors with
 * `PDSH_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT` exactly as before.

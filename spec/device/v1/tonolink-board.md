# TonoLink board phone-control interface, v1

Status: `implemented` (iOS consumer only; §4.1 voice turn `partial` until device evidence). Owner: P07. This registers an existing
boundary; it adds no wire format of its own.

A TonoLink board (`tonolink.m21r4`, firmware `agent_s3`) plugs into an iPhone's
USB-C port. It is the phone's **hands** (Bluetooth HID keyboard and absolute mouse)
and its **eyes** (an AirPlay receiver that the phone mirrors its screen to). Phone
DSH on the same phone runs the UI-Venus agent against it, with no computer.

The producer is the board firmware, outside this repository:
`tonolink-m21-r4-firmware` at `9ff0260` (`main/http/route_v1.c`, `main/link_tools.c`).
The consumer is `Sources/PhoneDSHBLE/TonoLink*.swift` plus
`Sources/PhoneDSHVenus/IPhoneAgent*.swift`. Android and HarmonyOS have no consumer.

## 1. Which channel carries what

| Need | Channel | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LED, Home HTTP | BLE Link Tools profile (`light.set`, `light.get`, `home.http`) | [ble-link.md](ble-link.md); reached by the agent through native MCP `ble_link_call` ([native-mcp.md](../../v1/native-mcp.md)) |
| Taps, swipes, typing | Board HTTP over USB NCM (§2) | this document |
| Screen | APV1 stream over USB NCM (§3) | this document |
| Pairing, console, BLE OTA (DEBUG) | TonoLink ctrl GATT service (§4) | this document |

Phone control does not use the Link Tools profile in v1: that profile excludes HID
([ble-link.md](ble-link.md)), and a screen frame cannot fit its 4096-byte RPC. Moving
HID actions into Link tools is a separate, not yet frozen change (phase 2); until it
is frozen, no end may send HID through Link.

## 2. Board HTTP over USB NCM

The board serves `http://192.168.247.1:8767` on the USB network it presents to
the phone (the phone takes `192.168.247.2`). Requests use `Connection: close`;
`auth` is `none` on these routes (the USB cable is the trust boundary).

| Route | Consumer use |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/info` | `model`, `fw.version`, `features` (display only) |
| `GET /v1/phone/status` | `hid.{keyboard,absolute,input_mode}` must all be true before input; `airplay.{mirror_active,viewer_connected}` |
| `POST /v1/hid/enable {"on":true}` | Re-attaches HID; the consumer waits ≥6 s before asking again |
| `POST /v1/hid/batch {"steps":[…],"wait":true}` | One gesture per batch; the consumer's HTTP timeout is 15 s plus the batch's planned duration |
| `POST /v1/usb {"action":"enable"}` | Brings NCM and the AirPlay receiver up (RAM-only on the board) |

A batch that times out or fails is reported to the model as "not executed: …" and
is **not retried**: the outcome on the phone is unknown. The agent re-observes the
screen before the next step. The one exception is `503` with `busy_exec`: the board's HID executor
was still finishing the previous batch and ran nothing of this one, so the consumer resends it
every 300 ms for up to about 3 s.

## 3. Screen stream (APV1)

The phone keeps one TCP connection to `192.168.247.1:8769`. The board sends the
mirrored screen as APV1 records (H.264 or HEVC), which `TonoLinkScreen` decodes in
software so it keeps working with the app in the background. iOS sends a keyframe
only when mirroring starts; the board caches the last GOP and replays it to a new
viewer, so the consumer may connect lazily. Each agent step observes a frame
decoded after the previous step's frame (`snapshot(newerThan:)`), never a stale one.

## 4. Ctrl GATT service

Service `5DBD66EC-9E78-42D4-854F-DE5EBBFFA363`: `cmd` `2D0EA61C-DCAC-48A2-816C-8DFF5022E6DE`
(write), `status` `4DF6DE7E-42FA-4F5E-92DE-BAD8AC1DE887` (notify, requires
encryption), optional `audio` `7A1C9E52-3B6D-4F08-9C2E-5D4B8A61F0A3`. Console lines
and BLE OTA framing are defined by `TonoLinkBLEDebugProtocol.swift` and
`TonoLinkUSBOTAProtocol.swift`, matching the firmware's `pa_ctrl_core.c`.

### 4.1 Voice turn (board wake word → phone)

Producer: `tonolink-m21-r4-firmware` at `4763811` (`main/wake.c`, `main/voice.c`,
`main/ctrl_svc.c`), present when `/v1/info` `features` has the `wake` bit. Consumer:
`Sources/PhoneDSHBLE/TonoLinkVoice.swift` and the app's `TonoLinkVoiceHost.swift`.
Shared cases: [golden/tonolink-voice.json](golden/tonolink-voice.json), the judge where
this text could be read two ways.

| Direction | Bytes | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` notify | `ev wake n=<u32> up=<u32>` | The board heard 你好小智. `n` counts hits from 1; `n=0` is the console's simulated wake. A new wake cancels the board's current recording. |
| `cmd` write | `<seq> listen <id>` (decimal, `id` 1…2³²−1) | Start one recording turn, numbered `id`. Answer `ack <seq> ok`; `ack <seq> err …` means no turn starts (nothing is recorded). |
| `audio` notify (`…F0A3`) | `[seq u16 LE][flags u8][id & 0xFF][Opus]` | One packet per 20 ms frame: Opus 16 kHz mono, VBR, DTX off, 0…160 bytes. `flags` bit0 first packet, bit1 last packet (the last may carry no Opus). `seq` restarts at 0 per turn. |
| `status` notify | `ev listen_end n=<id> frames=<u32> reason=vad\|no_speech\|max\|cancel\|error` | The turn ended (800 ms silence after speech, 5 s without speech, 12 s cap, a new wake, or an encoder/mic failure). |

Unknown `key=value` members after the known ones are ignored; any other `ev …` line, an
`ev wake`/`ev listen_end` missing a member or with a non-decimal value, and an unknown
`reason` are **not** events (ignored). An audio packet shorter than 4 bytes, longer than
164 bytes, without Opus and without the last flag, or whose id byte is not the low 8 bits of
the current turn's id is dropped.

Consumer rules: subscribe `audio` only while voice is enabled. The phone speaks 「我在」
**before** writing `listen` (the board would record it), and writes `listen` as soon as 「我在」
has played, not after the cloud ASR is ready. Each packet's Opus body is
forwarded unchanged and in order to the cloud ASR ([cloud-voice.md](../../v1/cloud-voice.md));
the 4-byte header never leaves the phone. A `seq` gap is counted, not filled. The turn's
audio ends at the last-flag packet or `ev listen_end`, whichever comes first. A wake while
a turn is recording, recognising or speaking stops that turn (its ASR is cancelled, its
playback stopped) and starts a new one. The phone keeps this link while in the background: a
restorable CoreBluetooth central with a parked reconnect, so `ev wake` wakes a suspended app
(`spec/platform/whitelist.json` `platform.tonolink-voice-background-wake`). The firmware is unchanged by
this registration.

## 5. DEBUG relay (developer builds only)

DEBUG builds can serve `TonoLinkRelay` on the phone's Wi-Fi at `:8780` and forward
`:8767` and `:8769`, so a computer can reach the board through the phone. The relay
has **no authentication**: anyone on that Wi-Fi can drive the phone and flash the
board while it is on. It is compiled only under `#if DEBUG`, listens only after a
user (or the `PDSH_TONOLINK_USB_OTA=relay` launch variable) turns it on, and is never
part of a release build.

DEBUG builds also answer developer test routes on the same relay, each mirroring a user action
or a read-only view, so a device check is one `curl` instead of a rebuild and UI taps:
`POST /debug/chat` (send one message, as the composer does), `GET /debug/transcript?n=`,
`GET /debug/native-mcp` (the last 20 native MCP requests: method, tool, whether the journal key
arrived, arguments, result), `GET /debug/ble`, `POST /debug/ble/scan` and
`POST /debug/ble/connect?name=` (the Bluetooth page's scan and 连接 buttons), `GET /debug/voice`
(the voice turn's state and last turn), `POST /debug/voice/wake` (as if the board heard 你好小智),
`POST /debug/voice/say` (speak a text) and `POST /debug/voice/opus[?chat=1]` (run recognition, and
optionally the chat turn, on `[len u16 LE][Opus]…` packets as if the board sent them).

## 6. Agent

`iphone_agent_run` ([native-mcp.md](../../v1/native-mcp.md)) runs one UI-Venus task:
screen in, one action out, executed through §2, up to the step limit. The model
endpoint, model name and key come from the app's UI-Venus settings (key in the
Keychain service `dev.phone-dsh.ui-venus`, never in preferences). The task result is
the model's assessment, not proof; `finished=false` must not be reported as success.

The agent does not trust its own actions blindly. Before each step it compares the new
screenshot with the previous one (36×52 grayscale, mean difference below 2/255 = unchanged);
when a tap, swipe, Home, launch, Enter or typing left the screen unchanged, the model is told
so. A run that repeats the same action three times, or goes back and forth between two actions
twice, gets one nudge, and that repeat is not performed (finish if the screen already shows
the answer, otherwise try something else). If it repeats itself again, the run stops with
`finished=false` and an answer starting 「卡住了」, instead of using every step. LaunchApp presses
Return a second time when Spotlight is still on screen, because the Pinyin keyboard's candidate
bar took the first one. For a read or check task the agent answers as soon as the screen shows the
information and never navigates away first; the tool's usage note tells the calling model to
describe what to report rather than "then go back" steps, and not to restart a task that ended
「卡住了」. Home taps 主屏幕 only after the AssistiveTouch menu is seen to open (the screen changes
by at least 6/255); otherwise it retries once, then looks for the button, and finally fails with a hint.
It never taps blind, which used to open whatever app sat under the menu item. A system permission
or privacy prompt ends the run with `CallUser`: the agent never chooses for the user.
